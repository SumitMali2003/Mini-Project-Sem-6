🎮 How to Run Locally

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

- git clone https://github.com/SumitMali2003/Mini-Project-Sem-6.git

2️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
- **REDUCED** it from installing the full GPU version, which is heavy and unnecessary for cloud deployment.

3️⃣ Run the App

---

streamlit run project.py

🚀 Deploying on Streamlit Cloud

	1.	Push your project to GitHub
	2.	Go to Streamlit Cloud
	3.	Deploy the app using your repository
	4.	Done! 🎉
